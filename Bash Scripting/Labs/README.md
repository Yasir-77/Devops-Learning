# üéÆ The Game: Bash Battle Arena 

The "Bash Battle Arena" is a command-line game codero designed to teach and improve Bash scripting skills in a fun and interactive way. The game presents players with a series of increasingly complex challenges that they must solve by writing Bash scripts. Each challenge is structured like a level in a game, and as players progress, they learn new Bash concepts and best practices.

Objective: Players must complete various tasks or "missions" using Bash scripts. These tasks range from simple file manipulations to more complex system operations. The goal is to "defeat" each level by correctly solving the problem, with the ultimate aim of becoming a "Bash Master."

### üìù NOTE


Now, there is no interactive VM to ssh into, or a website (yet) - so the game is played on your laptops, and your bash script solutions are shared on your learning GitHub repositories.

### üß± Game Structure

The games are level-based. You begin at level 1, and the difficulty increases as you go up the levels.

There is a Boss Battle every 5 levels designed to combine and reinforce the knowledge from the previous 5 levels.

Right now, there is no interface for the app - but soon there will be, and players will be scored based on their scripts' efficiency and speed.

## Level 10: Boss Battle 2 - Intermediate Scripting
Mission: Write a script that:

3. Generates a random number of lines (between 10 and 20) in each file.
4. Sorts these files by their size and displays the list.
5. Checks if any of the files contain the word 'Victory', and if found, moves the file to a directory called Victory_Archive.

## Level 11: Automated Disk Space Report
Mission: Create a script that checks the disk space usage of a specified directory and sends an alert if the usage exceeds a given threshold.

## Level 12: Simple Configuration File Parser
Mission: Write a script that reads a configuration file in the format KEY=VALUE and prints each key-value pair.

## nLevel 13: Backup Script with Rotation

1. Presents a menu to the user with the following options:
